# spx_options_strategies
Built using GenAI tools. I'm exploring how AI pair programming can enhance productivity, creativity, and fast prototyping.
This script requires a Tradier API key.
This project analyzes SPX market conditions (bias, volatility, liquidity) and recommends high-quality options strategies like credit spreads or iron condors. It leverages:

- Technical analysis (MACD, ADX, RSI)
- Volatility modeling (IV rank, 20D HV)
- Options chain filtering with delta targeting
- Trade quality scoring (Risk/Reward, liquidity, DTE)

⚠️ Built collaboratively using modern AI tools: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Copilot.

## Why this project?

As someone actively developing in Python, I wanted to explore the practical utility of GenAI coding tools to solve a real-world problem — in this case, surfacing trade ideas in a data-driven way. I used this opportunity to deepen my understanding of options logic, volatility indicators, and programmatic filtering.

## What I learned

- Advanced Python scripting (Pandas, requests, logging)
- Applying statistical techniques to financial data
- Designing filter logic around delta, premium, and risk
- Prompting AI tools for code quality, bug fixing, and refactoring
